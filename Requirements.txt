ActiveRecord: a bunch of capabilities/code that our Contact class inherits from.  Allows you to use SQL without writing SQL queries.  (ie. Contact.all.to_sql in the console will show you the barebone S(QL queries)

Parameters: two kinds of parameters (data that you want to pass over the internet) in a web application - query string parameters and POST data.  

Substitution: concept of mentally substituting/replacing what you see on the screen.


Stripe Integration
* Users should have a stripe customer token in the users table.
* Javascript should prevent Pro form from submitting, when user fills it out, and should send card info to Stripe. Stripe will return with a card token.
* Javascript should send user fields and card token to our rails app. Rails app should validate the user fields. Rails app will note whether plan 1 or plan 2.
* Once validated, Rails should send user info (email, plan id) and card token to Stripe server and Stripe will create a subscription and send back customer token. Rails should save customer token and user information to our database.
